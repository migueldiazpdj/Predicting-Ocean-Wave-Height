## Overview
In this project, we used a dataset collected from a buoy located near the entrance to the RÃ­a and port of A CoruÃ±a. The dataset contains environmental and oceanographic conditions measured over the past year. Our primary goal was to predict significant wave height using advanced machine learning models.

This analysis provides valuable insights for:
- Maritime operations
- Coastal safety
- Environmental monitoring
